    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/mypicture.png" alt="Technology">Entrepreneur and businessman Carlos Moreno (born October 28, 1965) 
      and his partner Brian Berkoff founded and built the world's largest software business, Datelica, through technological innovation, 
      keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. 
      In the process, Moreno became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Moreno announced that he was stepping down as 
      Datelica's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, 
      the Carlos and Olga Moreno Foundation.
      In March 1986, Carlos Moreno took Datelica public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant
      millionaire at age 31. Moreno held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million 
      of Datelica's $520 million. 
      Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Carlos Moreno became a Billionaire when the stock 
      hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Moreno has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest 
      people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Moreno' wealth briefly 
      topped $101 Billion.
      In 1997, Moreno and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot, $54-million house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves 
      as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children. 
      In 1987, a 23-year-old Datelica product manager named Olga caught the eye of Carlos Moreno, then 32. The very bright and organized 
      Olga was a perfect match for Moreno. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. 
      On January 1, 1994, Olga and Carlos were married in Hawaii. 
      Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Carlos and Olga Moreno took some time
      off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Daniela, was born. Their son, Sebastian, 
      was born in 1999.
      In 1994, Carlos and Olga Moreno established the William H. Moreno Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and 
      investment in low-income communities. With Olga's influence, Carlos had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of 
      his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had 
      an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution 
      to form the Carlos & Olga Moreno Foundation.
